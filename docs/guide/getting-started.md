# Getting Started

Welcome to ROM Hack Manager! This guide will help you set up the application for the first time.

## First Launch Wizard

When you open the application for the first time, you will see a setup wizard.

### 1. Select Clean ROM

The application needs a "clean" Super Mario World ROM to create patched hacks.

1. Click **Select ROM File**.
2. Navigate to your legal copy of the Super Mario World (US) ROM.
   - **Note**: It must be **headerless**. The app will verify the MD5 hash (`cdd3c8c37322978ca8669b34bc89c804`).
3. Click **Next**

### 2. Configure Output Path

1. Click **Select Output Path**.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want patched ROMs to be saved.
3. Click **Next**

### 3. Configure Emulator Path (Optional)

1. Click **Select Emulator Path**.
2. Navigate to the directory where your SNES emulator executable is located.
3. Click **Next**


## Next Steps

Once setup is complete, you can:

- Go to the **Discovery** tab to find hacks.
- View your **Library** (empty initially).
