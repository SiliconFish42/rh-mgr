# Getting Started

Welcome to ROM Hack Manager! This guide will help you set up the application for the first time.

## First Launch Wizard

When you open the application for the first time, you will see a setup wizard.

### 1. Select Clean ROM

The application needs a "clean" Super Mario World ROM to create patched hacks.

1. Click **Select ROM File**.
2. Navigate to your legal copy of the Super Mario World (US) ROM.
   - **Note**: It must be **headerless**. The app will verify the MD5 hash (`cdd3c8c37322978ca8669b34bc89c804`).
3. If valid, you'll see a green checkmark.

### 2. Configure Paths

You can configure these now or later in settings:

- **Emulator Path**: Point this to your SNES emulator executable.
- **Output Directory**: This is where patched ROMs will be saved. By default, it's in your Documents folder.

## Next Steps

Once setup is complete, you can:

- Go to the **Discovery** tab to find hacks.
- View your **Library** (empty initially).
